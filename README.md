# Semantic Segmentation
  Semantic Segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in the image. This is in contrast to classification, where a single label is assigned to the entire picture. Semantic segmentation treats multiple objects of the same class as a single entity. On the other hand, there is another type called instance segmentation that treats multiple objects of the same class as distinct individual objects (or instances).
  
In this repo, I have only shown how to use different semantic segmentation architectures using different frameworks and libraries like fastai, PyTorch, segmentation_models, etc.

Before using these notebooks, run the command:                                                                                 
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
   
Then in the ```notebooks/``` section there are several notebooks:
